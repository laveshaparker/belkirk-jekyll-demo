  ### What problem are we trying to solve?

  Mass Peer-to-Peer texting or "textbanking" software which enables campaigns to communicate out, even beyond their sms subscription lists with the help of volunteers.

  ### Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?

  MoveOn.org maintains Spoke and has contacted millions of people with it. It has benefited GetUp in Australia, initially for their successful marriage-equality campaign in 2017. Many other organizations are using it from Color of Change to the Working Families Party.
