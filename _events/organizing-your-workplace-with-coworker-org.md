  **Join us on October 23rd as Progressive HackNight and Coworker.org team up to discuss organizing your workplace!**

  Tech workers are standing up for their values and organizing in their workplaces. This energy is attracting news coverage and inciting action across the country. We're bringing Marley Pulido, the Director of Worker Resources and Training from Coworker.org, to Progressive HackNight to get to the nitty gritty of how to organize your workplace.

  We'll discuss what organizing looks like in tech and how to build winning campaigns. Then we'll go through practical exercises to practice how to respond to complications and backlash as you're organizing.

  Have you been trying to organize and run into problems? Have you been curious what "organizing the workplace" really looks like? If so, come learn with us!

  Progressive HackNight mobilizes tech workers for good. At Progressive HackNight, we design, plan, and organize around technology that addresses inequity and promotes a society that works for all. We take a strong stance that technology that breeds injustice and oppression should be dismantled.

  Our bi-weekly hacknights, open source projects, and issue-based campaigns educate and empower advocates and tech workers to create progressive change.

  This event is open to technologists, organizers, data enthusiasts, UX/UI designers, creatives, project managers, product managers, coders, etc... of all backgrounds/experiences.

  This week is a Working HackNight, which means there’ll be no speakers… just a full evening of hacking and strategizing! We’re going to collaborate on open-source projects, plan ways to help grassroots organizations, and learn from each other.

  At each HackNight, we have two types of breakout groups:

  Learning Groups - groups who want to learn new skills, discuss and strategize on issues, or refine their ideas.

  Working Groups - teams who provide opportunities for our community to use their skills by actively building technology and tools.

  Whether you’re a new or existing group, let us know if your breakout group will be at this HackNight, so we can announce what you’ll be working on in advance -- and volunteers can make sure to attend and connect with you! To get in touch with us, join the #project-leads channel on our Slack, or email us at organizers@progressivehacknight.org.

  Want to start a new breakout group? Start a new project issue on Github! Just click ‘New Issue’ and fill out the form so other attendees can learn about your group’s goals and needs.

  **No food will be provided this week, so remember to get dinner beforehand!**

  The schedule is as follows:

  6:30p - 6:50p : Registration & Mingling

  6:50p - 7:30p : Intro, Community News, Speaker, Breakout Group announcements

  7 - 9:30p : Breakout Groups
